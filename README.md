## Description

Welcome to my "First React Project with API Integration" repository! This project marks the beginning of my journey with React and Vite, and it involves integrating an external API to fetch and display data dynamically in a React application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: Usually comes bundled with Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/lucas-franc/first-react-project.git`

2. Change the current working directory:
`cd first-react-project`

3. Install dependencies:
`npm install`

4. Run the application:
`npm run dev`

5. Open the project in your browser:

The application should automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000/`. If not, open your browser and navigate to the mentioned URL.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Fetch data from an external API and display it in the React application.
- **Dynamic Content**: Update the content dynamically based on the API response, providing real-time data to the users.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for API requests and gracefully display error messages to users when necessary.

## Project Structure
